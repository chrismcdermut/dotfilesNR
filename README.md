# Dotfiles

This repository describes a personal system setup, designed on and for MacOS.

If you're looking for a starting point, `setup.sh` is a good spot.

While this stuff works best on a clean slate, I've made some effort to add compatibility with established systems; the ultimate goal is being able to use this repository to make any machine feel familiar.

Any suggestions are welcome, either to improve the setup script, or for useful packages/utilities worth adding to the list of installed goodies.
